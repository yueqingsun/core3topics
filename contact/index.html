                We are on camera, that's the scary thing. 
                We are all being watched, and every moment is recorded. 
                But then again, I guess we always were.

                It's just that now the cameras are everywhere, 
                catching every nervous tic and fleeting glance, 
                every smile that doesn't reach the eyes.
