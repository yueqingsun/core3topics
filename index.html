        "You had to live‚Äîdid live, 
        from habit that became instinct‚Äîin the assumption that every sound you made was overheard,

        "There were signs and glimpses, things watched and over-watched. 
        The house was under constant surveillance. What the cameras did not pick up, people did. 
        They worked in pairs, moving into each other‚Äôs territory. When you least expected it, 
        when you had not yet switched on a light, you would feel the cool sifting of air behind you, 
        someone leaning slightly, taking notes, observing your movements."

        "The telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously. 
        Any sound that Winston made, above the level of a very low whisper, 
        would be picked up by it; moreover, 
        so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque commanded, 
        he could be seen as well as heard. 
        There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. 
        How often, or on what system, 
        the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork."

        "There were eyes everywhere, and none of them human. The AI watched him,
